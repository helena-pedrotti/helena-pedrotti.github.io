### Working Papers

* **"Local Discretion in Low-Income Housing Policy: Evidence from France"**
    * *Abstract:* Governments seek to promote affordable housing development in mixed-income neighborhoods while preserving local municipal discretion over land use. Municipalities who retain local discretion better cater to local preferences, but only internalize preferences of incumbent residents and underprovide affordable housing. I quantify the trade-off in allowing municipal discretion over affordable housing provision when residents care about their peers. I leverage a discontinuity in a French policy which allows municipalities to build more social housing or pay a fine. Limiting local discretion increases social housing provision by over 30% and induces a compositional shift in the private housing stock: high-income households move out and low-incomes move in. I estimate a structural location choice model to quantify the welfare impacts of local discretion. Using the policy to identify heterogeneous preferences for low-income neighbors, I find that all households dislike low-income peers, especially high-income households who are willing-to-pay €538 per month to avoid a 20 p.p. increase in the share of low-income residents. Removing local discretion entirely in favor of a full mandate cuts the number of highly socioeconomically segregated municipalities in half.

### Works in Progress

* **"Zoning Against Neighborhood Change"**
    * *Abstract:* I quantify the insurance value embedded in residential zoning regulations. Zoning restricts neighbors’ efforts to redevelop their property and thus raises property values by providing insurance against local shocks. I develop a structural location choice model where risk-averse households derive utility from local amenities. These amenities are exposed to shocks and risk-averse households are willing to pay a risk-premium for zoning rules that will attenuate these shocks. To bring the model to data, I leverage the implementation in 2016 of a California law that permits many homeowners to construct additional dwelling units (ADUs) on their lot, thereby increasing density. Some homeowners within the same neighborhood remain ineligible to build ADUs and only bear the cost of this deregulation without benefiting. At the neighborhood level, this induces variation in potential housing density increases across neighborhoods. The model will match observed household sorting patterns in response to the law to identify the insurance value of zoning. I measure household-level mobility using Infutor data, while information on new housing development is drawn from the California Housing Element Annual Progress Reports. The estimated model will be used to quantify the welfare effects of counterfactual simulations of alternative zoning regimes.

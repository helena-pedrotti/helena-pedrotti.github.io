Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at NYU.

I combine reduced-form empirical methods and structural modeling to answer questions about (i) the role of housing and urban policy in mitigating socioeconomic inequalities, and (ii) how various levels of governments interact to implement spatial policies.

Research interests: public economics, industrial organization, urban economics. 

I will be on the 2025-2026 job market.

 You can find my CV <a href="assets/docs/cv.pdf" style="color: #267cb9;">here</a> 
  and my job market paper <a href="assets/docs/jmp.pdf" style="color: #267cb9;">here</a>.
